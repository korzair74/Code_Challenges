We provided some simple React template code. Your goal is to modify the
component so that you can properly toggle the button to switch
between an ON state and an OFF state. When the button is on
and it is clicked, it turns off and the text within it changes 
from ON to OFF and vice versa. Make use of component state for 
this challenge.

Submit your code once it is complete and our system will 
validate your output.
