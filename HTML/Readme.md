 This is a folder of all the code challenges that I did during Bottega Course.

# Git Commands

```
- Add files to be staged
```
$ git add .
```
- Commit files (also known as a save point)
```
$ git commit -m "Your commit message goes here"
```

  - You need to have a git repository on github to do this.  If you don't follow the next steps
```
$ git push
OR
$ git push origin master
```
- Create a github repo
  - Go to github
  - Click the plus icon
  - Click new repo
  - Repo name should be the same name as the folder
  - Click create repo
  - Copy the code from this section.  â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
